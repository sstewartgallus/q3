### What is Q^3?
Q^3 is a very new project using Mozilla's Rust language and OpenGL to create a Quake 3 like game.
The goal of this project is not to be Quake 3, but to be its own game. My goal is to take Quake 3 and QuakeLive maps, voxelize them, allow groups of players to join, and blow the shit out of everything in a fast-paced Quake-esque first person shooter. 

### What's the current state of Q^3?
Q^3 is not a game yet! It's still a side project that I'm working on in my spare time.  
**Current features:**
* Half-baked BSP renderer (Quake 3 and Quake Live)
  * Quake Live map rendering is... buggy
* TTF renderer
* Arbitrary mesh voxelizer (for BSP maps)
  * Using Separating Axis Theorem and instance rendering (it's not that fast)
* Basic UI with drop-down console that provides in-game tweaking/debugging
* Tested on Linux and Mac OS X

### How do I get Q^3 running on my system?
I run on the (nearly) latest Rust incoming; I generally pull every few days. Q^3 currently has 
[glfw3](https://github.com/glfw/glfw), 
[glfw-rs](https://github.com/Jeaye/glfw-rs), 
[rust-opengles](https://github.com/Jeaye/rust-opengles), and 
[rust-stb-image](https://github.com/mozilla-servo/rust-stb-image), 
as submodules. To configure, simply run:  
```bash
./configure
```
From there, you should be able to compile and run a release build with:  
```bash
make release && ./bin/q3
```
**NOTE:** Ensure that you have Freetype2 installed.  
**NOTE:** I don't have access to a Windows machine at the moment, so I'm not sure yet what will go into building 
this in something like Visual Studio. If you're interested in looking into it, please feel free to send me a pull
request!
